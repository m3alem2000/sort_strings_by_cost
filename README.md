Problem:
Write a method sort_strings_by_cost
Parameters: array
An array of strings (lower-case alpha characters only)
Returns: array
The input array with strings sorted according to each string's "cost" in ascending order
A string's "cost" is the sum of the cost of each letter.
The cost of each letter is its place in the alphabet (e.g. a = 1, z = 26) 
Example:
sort_strings_by_cost([tem, cab, exz]) returns [cab, tem, exz]
